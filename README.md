# COMP5970-Assignment10-DailyActOfKindness

The goal for this assignment was to take a very simple app that includes basic navigation and integrates Firebase Authentication.

The idea for this app was to show the user a random act of kindness for the day that they could complete and then check off, and keep track of their progress over time.

There is no real functionality except for the basic requirements as of now.

## Assignment Requirements:

Your app should:

- Support email/password signup and login

- Include a basic navigation flow, such as showing a home screen after login

- Handle simple error states (e.g., incorrect credentials)

- Include a logout button

## Note about `GoogleService-Info.plist'

This code requires a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to be added to the Project so that it can connnect to my Firebase. 

If you are the grader for this, I will send you this file directly.
