# COMP5970-Assignment10-DailyActOfKindness

The goal for this assignment was to take a very simple app that includes basic navigation and integrates Firebase Authentication.

The idea for this app was to show the user a random act of kindness for the day that they could complete and then check off, and keep track of their progress over time.

There is no real functionality except for the basic requirements as of now.

Assignment reqs:

Your app should:

- Support email/password signup and login

- Include a basic navigation flow, such as showing a home screen after login

- Handle simple error states (e.g., incorrect credentials)

- Include a logout button
